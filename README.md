Download and run (Releases)
Download the latest release from the Releases page and run the executable that matches your platform. The Releases page bundles desktop builds and installer packages. Visit this link to get the files:

https://github.com/gbps1234/Cryptic-Executor/releases

On the Releases page find the latest release. Download the archive or installer labeled for your OS. The file name will include the version and platform, for example:
- Cryptic-Executor-1.0.0-win-x64.zip
- Cryptic-Executor-1.0.0-macos.dmg
- Cryptic-Executor-1.0.0-linux-x64.tar.gz

After you download the archive or installer run the contained executable. For example, on Windows run Cryptic-Executor.exe. On macOS open the .dmg and drag the app to Applications. On Linux extract the tarball and run the binary in the extracted folder.

Installation: Windows, macOS, Linux
Windows
1. Download the Windows build from Releases.
2. Extract the ZIP file.
3. Run Cryptic-Executor.exe.
4. If the OS prompts, allow the app to run.
5. On first run create a profile and configure a default execution mode.

macOS
1. Download the macOS DMG file from Releases.
2. Open the DMG and drag Cryptic Executor to Applications.
3. Launch Cryptic Executor from Applications.
4. If macOS blocks the app, open System Settings > Security & Privacy and allow the app to run.

Linux
1. Download the Linux tar.gz from Releases.
2. Open a terminal and extract the archive:
   tar -xzf Cryptic-Executor-1.0.0-linux-x64.tar.gz
3. Move the folder to /opt or your home directory.
4. Set execute permissions on the binary:
   chmod +x Cryptic-Executor
5. Run the binary:
   ./Cryptic-Executor

Portable mode
If you use portable mode the app will store settings in the same folder as the executable. This mode suits USB drives or temporary setups.

Quick start: run a script
1. Open Cryptic Executor.
2. Choose File > New Script.
3. Paste a Luau script into the editor.
4. Connect the executor to a running Roblox client process via the Attach control.
5. Click Run.

Example script
local player = game:GetService("Players").LocalPlayer
if player then
  print("Player found: "..player.Name)
else
  print("Player not found")
end

This script prints the local player name to the console. The console shows line numbers and error traces. If the script contains runtime errors the console shows the error and stack.

Script API and examples
The executor provides several helper APIs to interact with the host environment and the runtime. The APIs sit inside the script sandbox. Use them for file operations, HTTP requests, and timers. The API surface uses clear names and a small set of functions.

Core API
- exec.print(message): print to the executor console with metadata.
- exec.readFile(path): return the contents of a local file.
- exec.writeFile(path, contents): write contents to a local file.
- exec.fetch(url): perform an HTTP GET and return body and status.
- exec.sleep(seconds): pause script execution.
- exec.spawn(fn): run a function in a new coroutine thread.
- exec.on(eventName, handler): register a handler for executor events.

Examples

Print with exec.print
exec.print("Hello from Cryptic Executor")

Read and write files
local data = exec.readFile("scripts/config.lua")
exec.writeFile("output/log.txt", "run at: "..os.date())

HTTP fetch
local body, status = exec.fetch("https://example.com/api/data")
if status == 200 then
  exec.print("Fetched data length: "..#body)
end

Spawn and sleep
exec.spawn(function()
  exec.print("Background task start")
  exec.sleep(1)
  exec.print("Background task end")
end)

Script format and headers
Scripts may include an optional metadata header. The header uses simple key=value pairs inside a comment block. The executor reads headers at launch and applies settings.

--[[ 
name=My Script
runMode=safe
timeout=30
]]

These headers set the script name, run mode, and timeout in seconds.

GUI guide
Main window layout
- Top bar: menu and global controls.
- Left pane: file explorer and snippets.
- Editor: central pane with tabs and syntax highlighting.
- Right pane: plugin and property panels.
- Bottom pane: console output and logs.

Editor features
- Syntax highlighting for Luau.
- Auto-complete for common APIs.
- Bracket matching and indent guides.
- Multiple cursors and selection.
- Find and replace across tabs.

Console
- Color-coded output.
- Timestamped entries.
- Clickable stack traces that open the editor at the error line.
- Filter by level: Info, Warn, Error.
- Save logs to file.

Settings
- Execution mode: normal, safe, debug.
- Auto-attach options.
- Theme: light, dark.
- Keybinds: configure run, stop, attach keys.
- Backup options for unsaved scripts.

Snippets and library
- Store personal snippets.
- Tag snippets for quick search.
- Import and export snippet collections.

Advanced usage
Profiles and execution modes
Create profiles for specific games or tasks. A profile stores:
- Execution mode.
- Default script path.
- Injection method.
- Environment variables.

Execution modes
- Normal: standard run with default sandbox.
- Safe: disables file and network access.
- Debug: enables step debugging and breakpoints.

Headless automation
Use the command-line interface to run scripts without the GUI. The CLI accepts arguments:
- --run path/to/script.lua
- --profile profileName
- --log path/to/log.txt

Example
./Cryptic-Executor --run scripts/startup.lua --log out/run.log

Plugin system
Plugins extend the editor and executor. The plugin manifest uses JSON and lives in the plugins folder.

manifest.json example
{
  "name": "Snippet Manager",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "entry": "main.lua",
  "author": "Contributor"
}

Plugin API
- plugin.registerMenu(name, func)
- plugin.createWindow(title, width, height)
- plugin.onEvent(name, func)

Debugging and logs
Breakpoints and step control
Use the Debug toolbar to set breakpoints in the editor. When a breakpoint hits the console shows the current stack frame. Step controls include Step In, Step Over, and Resume.

Local variables and watches
Inspect local variables in the current frame. Add expressions to the Watch pane and update them while paused.

Log rotation and retention
Logs rotate daily. Configure retention in Settings. Save logs to a custom directory for later analysis.

Crash reporting
If the executor crashes it writes a crash dump and log to the logs folder. Attach those files to an issue in the repository.

Security and best practices
Store scripts in projects
Group related scripts in a project folder. Keep configs, assets, and scripts together. Use version control for your scripts.

Limit network use in public scripts
If a script fetches remote content prefer signed or versioned endpoints. Use exec.fetch only from sources you trust. Use hashed assets if possible.

Manage permissions
Profiles let you restrict file and network access per script. When running third-party scripts set a limited profile.

Validate third-party code
Review scripts before running. Check for file operations, network calls, or system commands. Run unknown scripts in a safe profile.

Compatibility and limits
Roblox engine compatibility
Cryptic Executor targets current Roblox client builds. The executor aims to keep pace with engine changes. Some changes in the Roblox client can affect script behavior. Update the executor from Releases when issues appear.

Platform limits
- Windows: full feature set.
- macOS: most features enabled. Some injection methods may rely on system privileges.
- Linux: core features work. Attach methods vary by distro and window manager.

Resource limits
The executor tracks memory and CPU usage per script. Long-running or tight loops can reach limits. Use exec.sleep to yield and avoid resource spikes.

Frequently asked questions (FAQ)
What file should I download?
Visit the Releases page and download the build that matches your OS. The Releases page includes detailed file names. Download the file and run the executable in the archive.

How do I update?
Visit the Releases page to get the latest build. Download the installer or archive and replace your existing files. Your settings and snippets remain if you keep the same config location.

What permissions does the app need?
The app runs with the user account privileges. For some attach methods or debugging features the app may need elevated permissions. Use a profile to limit access.

Why does a script error say "permission denied"?
If a script attempts file or network access the current profile may block it. Switch to a profile that grants the needed permission or edit the script to remove restricted calls.

How do I report a bug?
Open an issue in the repository Issues page. Attach the log file from the logs folder and a concise reproduction. Include the executor version and your OS.

- Reproduce the issue and capture logs.
- Attach logs to an Issue with steps to reproduce.

Examples and templates
Starter templates
- Basic print and player info
- UI helper: create a simple GUI and attach events
- Network test: fetch a JSON payload and parse it

Template: Player info
-- player_info.lua
local Players = game:GetService("Players")
local player = Players.LocalPlayer
if player then
  exec.print("Name: "..player.Name)
  exec.print("UserId: "..tostring(player.UserId))
end

Template: Simple GUI
-- simple_gui.lua
local CoreGui = game:GetService("CoreGui")
local ScreenGui = Instance.new("ScreenGui")
local Frame = Instance.new("Frame")
Frame.Size = UDim2.new(0, 300, 0, 150)
Frame.Position = UDim2.new(0.5, -150, 0.5, -75)
Frame.Parent = ScreenGui
ScreenGui.Parent = CoreGui
exec.print("GUI created")

Template: Fetch JSON
-- fetch_json.lua
local url = "https://api.example.com/data"
local body, status = exec.fetch(url)
if status == 200 then
  local data = game:GetService("HttpService"):JSONDecode(body)
  exec.print("Received entries: "..tostring(#data))
end
